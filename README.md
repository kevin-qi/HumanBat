# HumanBat

Welcome to the Human Bat Project! 

This project consists of a battery of 3 tasks involving a human, a bat (or bats), and food reward that aim to elicit representation of the human in the bat's brain. Wireless electrophysiology will be used to record from hippocampus CA1 during the three tasks.
